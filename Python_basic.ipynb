What is the difference between == and is operators in Python\n","- == is used to check equality and is operator is used to check memory location equality.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","- The logical operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","- Type casting is converting one data type to another\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","- Implicit: Done automatically by Python (e.g., int to float).\n","- Explicit: Done manually by the programmer using functions like `int()`, `float().\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","- They control the flow of execution based on conditions.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","- elif (else if) checks another condition if the previous if or elif was False.\n","\n","13.  What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","- for loops iterate over sequences; while loops run as long as a condition is true.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","- When the number of iterations is unknown beforehand-like waiting for user input or a condition to be met.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yOG6KUGmW2_e"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"j-4XpSmeWeDc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746711585490,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":15,"user":{"displayName":"kaify azami","userId":"07772239257487614050"}},"outputId":"77404a08-cbd3-4e24-d2d4-0ab3c588288f"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}],"source":["#1.Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\n","\n","print('Hello, World!')"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2.Write a Python program that displays your name and age\n","\n","name = \"kaify\"\n","age = 31\n","\n","print(\"Name:\",name)\n","print(\"Age:\",age)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"l2Jofqo5HrYu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746711872505,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":30,"user":{"displayName":"kaify azami","userId":"07772239257487614050"}},"outputId":"e732cd58-5067-4c89-9ebf-92aa7797441f"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Name: kaify\n","Age: 31\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#3.Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library.\n","\n","import keyword\n","\n","print(keyword.kwlist)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"GpRWfyVZJIuw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746712372020,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"kaify azami","userId":"07772239257487614050"}},"outputId":"6fdaa59e-1c82-4b5f-fa93-38c84b51fe0e"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#4.Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword\n","import keyword\n","word = input(\"Enter a word: \")\n","if keyword.iskeyword(word):\n","    print(f\"'{word}' is a Python keyword.\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"'{word}' is not a Python keyword.\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"0d9EDp22K8ks","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746712989485,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2673,"user":{"displayName":"kaify azami","userId":"07772239257487614050"}},"outputId":"d0143763-cb37-42ff-9514-7ec5ec0e81fe"},"execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter a word: True\n","'True' is a Python keyword.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#5.
